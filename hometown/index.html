	<p class="subtext">Vasai Fort</p>

	<p class="text">Vasai is a historical place and important village in Mumbai's western suburbs, located in Palghar district. It also forms a 	part of Vasai-Virar village in the state of Maharashtra in the Konkan division in India. Vasai was in the Thane district prior to 2014.
		The Portuguese built the Vasai Fort here to strengthen their naval superiority over the Arabian Sea. The fort was taken over by the Maratha Army in 1739, ending the Battle of Vasai.The British then took over the territory from the Maratha Empire in 1780 during the First Anglo-Maratha War.As a legacy of Portuguese colonialism, East Indian Catholics form a small minority of the population.
		The present name Vasai is derived from the Sanskrit word <b>Waas</b>, meaning 
		<!-- quotation tag -->
		<q>dwelling</q> or <q>residence</q>and it was confounded by Stock Raani. The oldest known name for the region is Mhatre Ilaka.The name was changed to Basai, which was named under Bahadur Shah of Gujarat after the Gujarat Sultanate took over the region. This is also the first Latinised record of the name, which was spelt as Baxay by Barbosa (1514).The name was short-lived as it was changed under Portuguese rule, approximately two decades later, to Baçaim (also first official Latin name) following the signing of the Treaty of Baçaim in 1534.

	<p class="text">A resident of Vasai is called Vasaikar in Marathi, in which the suffix kar means <q>resident of</q>. The term had been in 	use for since the official renaming of Bassein to Vasai. The Vasaikar diaspora outside of Maharashtra state, as well as outside of India, refer to themselves as from Mumbai due to its international recognition and Vasai being located within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, near the edge of suburban Mumbai. This change came into effect from June 27, 2020.
